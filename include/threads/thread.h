/* A kernel thread or user process.
 *
 * Each thread structure is stored in its own 4 kB page.  The
 * thread structure itself sits at the very bottom of the page
 * (at offset 0).  The rest of the page is reserved for the
 * thread's kernel stack, which grows downward from the top of
 * the page (at offset 4 kB).  Here's an illustration:
 *
 *      4 kB +---------------------------------+
 *           |          kernel stack           |
 *           |                |                |
 *           |                |                |
 *           |                V                |
 *           |         grows downward          |
 *           |                                 |
 *           |                                 |
 *           |                                 |
 *           |                                 |
 *           |                                 |
 *           |                                 |
 *           |                                 |
 *           |                                 |
 *           +---------------------------------+
 *           |              magic              |
 *           |            intr_frame           |
 *           |                :                |
 *           |                :                |
 *           |               name              |
 *           |              status             |
 *      0 kB +---------------------------------+
 *
 * The upshot of this is twofold:
 *
 *    1. First, `struct thread' must not be allowed to grow too
 *       big.  If it does, then there will not be enough room for
 *       the kernel stack.  Our base `struct thread' is only a
 *       few bytes in size.  It probably should stay well under 1
 *       kB.
 *
 *    2. Second, kernel stacks must not be allowed to grow too
 *       large.  If a stack overflows, it will corrupt the thread
 *       state.  Thus, kernel functions should not allocate large
 *       structures or arrays as non-static local variables.  Use
 *       dynamic allocation with malloc() or palloc_get_page()
 *       instead.
 *
 * The first symptom of either of these problems will probably be
 * an assertion failure in thread_current(), which checks that
 * the `magic' member of the running thread's `struct thread' is
 * set to THREAD_MAGIC.  Stack overflow will normally change this
 * value, triggering the assertion. */
/* The `elem' member has a dual purpose.  It can be an element in
 * the run queue (thread.c), or it can be an element in a
 * semaphore wait list (synch.c).  It can be used these two ways
 * only because they are mutually exclusive: only a thread in the
 * ready state is on the run queue, whereas only a thread in the
 * blocked state is on a semaphore wait list. */
